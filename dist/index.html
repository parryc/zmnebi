<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In all but the eyes of the most savvy of learners, Georgian verbs present a wide variety of challenges and every learner has their own approach to these challenges. My personal approach is to try to lay things out systematically – partially to clarify my thoughts and partially so that I have an easy reference.</p>
<p>When I say systematically, though, I don't mean scholarly or exhaustively. Both have their uses – indeed, I wouldn't have much of what I have below without either scholarly or exhaustivly documented materials – but as a learner, that type of depth and complexity can often serve as a deterrent. Therefore, what this page attempts to accomplish is thus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the parts of the Georgian verb</li>
<li>Describe the types of Georgian verbs</li>
<li>Document which noun cases are used with which Georgian verbs</li>
<li>Document the various cases of Georgian verbs with examples</li>
<li>Provide references for those wishing to know more</li>
</ol>
<p>Much of what I have written below is based off of Shorena Kurtsikidze's <em>Essentials of Georgian Grammar, 2nd ed.</em> and P. J. Hillery's <a href="https://home.richw.org/armazi/georgian/">Georgian Language</a> website (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230107010249/https://home.richw.org/armazi/georgian/">backup link</a>). I will use Ⓚ and Ⓗ respectively to mark how something is referenced in those materials. Ⓞ will be used if I have come across other terms for the same phenomenon. It is not always a one-to-one match, but that's just the fun of Georgian verbs!</p>
<p>The path to learning, understanding, and internalizing Georgian verbs is not linear. It's a winding path: much what is written below will be written in multiple places. Hopefully this serves to reinforce your understanding, rather than to confuse you.</p>
<h1 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h1>
<p>This is a constant work in progress, so if you see any errors, want to provide examples (especially if your mother tongue is not English!) or have other suggestions/comments, please email me at <code>parry</code> @ <code>parryc.com</code>.</p>
<h1 id="the-parts-of-a-georgian-verb">The Parts of a Georgian Verb</h1>
<p>Let's start with the basic parts of the verb. We'll use a verb in the future tense to indicate what each part is.</p>

</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>These parts are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>preverb</strong>: a prefix used in some tenses.</li>
<li><strong>person markers</strong>: can either be before, after, or on both sides of the root, depending on the person. Georgian verbs distinguish between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person, as well as singular or plural. There is no distinction in gender.</li>
<li><strong>version</strong>: a vowel before the root that can indicate to whom the action is directed, among other things.</li>
<li><strong>root</strong>: the core part of the word that everything is tacked on to.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr></strong>: the "Present Future Stem Format", which is a vowel+consonant syllable (vowel is optional) that appears after the root in some tenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of all these parts, personally, I don't think trying to explicitly remember the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> is useful, due to its variability across verbs. Some verbs don't even have one, so there's that too. Thus, in general, when the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> is referred to below, think of it as the ობ, ებ, ავ, etc. syllable that ends a verb in the present tense. It is brought up specifically because some tenses drop the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> – with practice, you will get a feel for these syllables, especially when you have more verbs in your verb-box.</p>
<h2 id="preverb">Preverb</h2>
<p>The preverb is affixed to front of the verb, before the person markers. It is used with all tenses, except <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr>, <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>. In most cases, it functions as a perfective marker (versus imperfective, without it), meaning that the action is a complete action with a start and end. If that doesn't make intuitive sense for you, read up on the term to get examples for your language of choice. For verbs of motion, it indicates the direction of motion. It is VERY important as a learner to learn the preverb when learning a new verb. I recommend always learning a preverb form of the verb along with the present tense when learning a new verb. This is often best accomplished by also learning the <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> form of the verb.</p>
<p>Additionally, the preverb used may change based on the meaning of the verb, even when directionality is not involved. That is, a non-preverb form, such as <code>ქრება:disappears, goes out</code>, will use a preverb of <em>გა-</em> when verb means "goes out (of a light)", but <em>ჩა-</em> when it means "goes out (of a fire)". In tenses where a preverb is not used, context will indicate the meaning.</p>
<p>The list of preverbs is:</p>
<ul>
<li>მი – away from the speaker</li>
<li>მო – towards the speaker</li>
<li>გა – outwards (e.g. inside to outside)</li>
<li>შე – inwards (e.g. outside to inside)</li>
<li>ა – upwards</li>
<li>ჩა – downwards</li>
<li>წა – away from the speaker (not used with <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr>, <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr><cite>Kurts. 164</cite>)</li>
<li>და – general motion, often implies walking</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also combination preverbs:</p>
<ul>
<li>გადა – going over</li>
<li>გამო - away from the speaker or inside going to outside</li>
<li>გადმო – going over towards the speaker</li>
<li>შემო – inside towards the speaker, things done by accident, or around something</li>
<li>ამო - upwards towards the speaker</li>
<li>ჩამო – downwards toward the speaker</li>
<li>წამო – towards the speaker (it is not used with <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr>, <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr><cite>Kurts. 164</cite>). When used with "to go", it indicates the going has not yet compeleted, ex. <code>წამოვა:will set out (but not necessarily reach the destination)</code>.</li>
<li>მიმო – back and forth</li>
</ul>
<p>The speaker, here, may also be the 2nd person in the conversation. That is, it is often necessary to use the <em>-მო-</em> version of the preverb when responding to a question from someone.</p>
<p>To illustrate this nuance, let's first look at <code>გზავნის:sends</code>. Assume that someone has asked you if you've sent something. The most basic form in the past tense for <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> would be <em>მე გავგზავნე</em>, I sent it. <em>გა-</em> is the base preverb and there is no recipient. However, if you sent it to the person you're talking to, it's not enough to add the <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr> object marker <em>-გ-</em>. It is also necessary to add <em>-მო-</em> to the preverb since the action is directed , giving <em>მე გამოგიგზავნე</em>, I sent it to you.</p>
<p>This can be further seen in the following dialogues. Pretend your are meeting a friend at a restaurant and friend has called you on the phone as you have reached the door.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friend: სალამი, მე ვარ რესტორანში. სად ხარ შენ? (Hello, I'm at the restaurant, where are you?)</li>
<li>You: მე ახლა შე<em>მო</em>ვდივარ რესტორანში. (Hello, I'm going into the restaurant now.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the <em>-მო-</em> infixed above in <code>შევდივარ:I'm going in</code>. The <em>-მო-</em> here is necessary since you are going in towards where your friend is, aka the restaurant.</p>
<p>Compare this 2nd scenario, where your friend is running late.</p>
<ul>
<li>Friend: სალამი, მე მაგვიანდება, შენ სად ხარ? (Hello, I'm running late, where are you?)</li>
<li>You: სალამი, მე ახლა შევდივარ რესტორანში. (Hello, I'm going into the restaurant now).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there is no <em>-მო-</em> necessary here, since the friend you are responding to is not in the restaurant and thus the direction of your action is not towards the speaker.</p>
<p>In addition to what was outlined above, there are also three archaic preverbs that are used in fossilized forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>წარ/წარმო - ex. <code>წარმოიდგენს:will imagine something</code></li>
<li>გან - ex. <code>განსაზღვრავს:will set the limits on something</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="person-markers">Person Markers</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓞ: Some resources refer to Georgian verbs as being "polypersonal", i.e. one verb contains person markers for both subject and object.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two sets of person markers for Georgian verbs, ვ-class or მ-class. <em>ვ</em> and <em>მ</em> refer to the first person singular person marker. They are listed below. "Stem", in the charts below, refers to both the root and the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr>, if the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> is included for the tense.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Singular">SG</abbr> forms and <abbr title="1st Person Plural">1PL</abbr> will have one of two endings: <em>-ა</em> or <em>-ს</em>. There is not a set rule as to which types of verbs have <em>-ა</em> and which have <em>-ს</em>, but generally, those with <em>-ს</em> have an implied object, such as <code>მაქვს:I have (it)</code>, whereas those with <em>-ა</em> do not (<code>მშია:I am hungry</code>). It is this ending that is replaced in <abbr title="2nd Person Plural">2PL</abbr> and <abbr title="3rd Person Plural">3PL</abbr>.</p>
<p>In <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> and <abbr title="3rd Person Plural">3PL</abbr>, one may find an <em>ს</em> or <em>ჰ</em> pre-stem person marker, such as in <code>მოსწონს:s/he likes</code> or <code>ჰქვია:s/he is called</code>. <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr> has these marked as superscripts which do not disrupt the alphabetical ordering of the dictionary, but should be learned when memorizing the verb, since they are written in the tenses in the 1st series (as described below). In fast or casual speech, the <em>ს</em> and <em>ჰ</em> are dropped by some speakers.</p>
<p>An example, with <code>აქვს:has (a thing)</code> in <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>:</p>

<p>Personal pronouns can be dropped in Georgian, as markers for person are attached directly to the verb. Verbs take one of two forms of indicating person, either ვ-class or მ-class.</p>
<p>The object of the sentence can also be indicated in the verb construction, too. <a href="#comrie">Comrie 2017</a> breaks this down into a set of rules that can help clear up when an object indicator is used. When a verb agrees with (or as Comrie puts it "indexes") the object, the მ-class markers are used.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>ვ-ხედავ <em>I see it</em></li>
<li>ხედავ <em>You see it</em></li>
<li>ხედავ-ს <em>She sees it</em></li>
<li>მ-ხედავ-ს <em>She sees me</em></li>
<li>გ-ხედავ-ს <em>She sees you</em></li>
<li>მ-ხედავ <em>You see me</em></li>
<li>გ-ხედავ <em>I see you</em></li>
<li>გ-ხედავ-თ <em>We see you</em></li>
</ol>
<p>It is clear for when both of the მ/ვ-class markers are used, such as in example 4 (ex. <code>მ-</code> is always <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> and <code>-ს</code> is always <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr>), but when the person is marked with <code>∅</code>, it is more difficult. Two few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the subject marker does not conflict with the object marker for place (i.e. before the root or after the root), it will be used. Otherwise, the object marker is the only one used. Thus, <code>გ-ხედავ-ს</code> (ex. 5) but not <code>გ-ვ-ხედავ</code> (ex. 7) (which would be interpreted as <code>გვ-</code> which is for <abbr title="1st Person Plural">1PL</abbr> მ-class verbs).</li>
<li>The object cannot be the same as or inclusive of the subject, meaning <code>გ-ხედავ</code> cannot be "you saw yourself" and <code>გ-ხედავ-თ</code> cannot be "you all saw you" (since "you" is a part of "you all"). Reflexiveness is indicated in other ways, such as with <code>თავი:head</code> or the <em>ი</em> version (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, the strangely ambiguous <code>გ-ხედავ</code> would be analyzed as <em>I see you</em>, because of the two principals above: there is no overt subject marker (so it can be either <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> – before-root person marker and thus obfuscated by the object – or <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr>, which is ∅) and the subject and object can never match. Thus, the subject must be <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr>.</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, many მ-class verbs that can logically take a 1st or 2nd person object (such as "I love you", "We desire y'all", etc.) may also mark the object of the verb with <a href="#how-to-form-prs">the <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> "to be" form</a> for the person which is the object (<abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> = ვარ, <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr> = ხარ, etc.). For example, in "I love you", "I" is the subject and "you" is the object. This gives:</p>
<table class="bracket_table">

<p>Or in the case where the subject would be marked by <em>ს/ჰ-</em> (i.e. 3rd person), then these prefixed person markers will be replaced by the ვ-class marker if the object is <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> or <abbr title="1st Person Plural">1PL</abbr>.</p>

<p>One will still often find the pronoun for the object in the sentence. Thus, <ex><em>მე შენ მიყვარხარ</em> ⧸ I love you</ex>. This form of marking the object <em>does not</em> occur outside of <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>. In the case where the affixed verb form would have two ვs (such as <code>გყავვარ:you have me</code>), only one ვ is written (<em>გყავარ</em>). Verbs that commonly have this form are those which express interpersonal emotions: <code>უყვარს:loves</code>, <code>სძულს:hates</code>, <code>უნდება:desires</code>, or <code>მოსწონს:likes</code>. However, in theory, any მ-class verb could take this form, if contextually relevant.</p>
<h2 id="version">Version</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Version<br />
Ⓗ: Pre-radical vowel<br />
Ⓞ: The term version comes from the Georgian <code>ქცევა:change</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Version describes the optional prefixed vowel that comes before the root. These vowels serve a variety of purposes, as listed below. Because of the variability in meaning, there is not always a single name associated with the version and so in this document, I simply refer to the vowel used.</p>
<h3 id="version-">Version ა-</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Neutral version<br />
Ⓗ: Various, Superessive version<br />
Ⓞ: [<abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>] Superessive version is marked with <em>v sup</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the neutral version marker. It is often used to "verbify" a word, such <code>დიდი:big</code>  → <code>ადიდებს:makes bigger</code>. Similar to the preverb <code>ა:upwards</code>, it can also mean that the action is done on a surface, such as <code>ახატავს:paints on something</code>. This is what is meant by the term <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/superessive_case">superessive</a>.</p>
<h3 id="version-_1">Version ი-</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Subjective version<br />
Ⓗ: Various, Benefactive version</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This version is a reflexive version, indicating that the object is also the subject. Compare <code>იწონის:he weighs himself</code> versus <code>წონის:he weighs (something)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="version-_2">Version უ-</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Objective version<br />
Ⓗ: Unnamed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This version indicates that the object is for a third party. Compare <code>ვუკეთებ:I'm doing it (for her)</code> versus <code>ვაკეთებ:I'm doing it</code>. <em>-უ-</em> is also seen often when the object of the action is one's self, ex. <ex><em>მე გავუკეთე პიცა ჩემ თავს</em> ⧸ I made the pizza for myself</ex>. (Note, here, that if <code>ჩემთვის:for me</code> was used instead <em>-უ-</em> would not be used, since <em>ჩემთვის</em> is not a noun.)</p>
<h2 id="root">Root</h2>
<p>The is the "core" of the verb and is never learned in isolation. It is helpful as a marker to idenfity verbs with similar meaning, such as, <code>ეძახის:calls someone something</code>, <code>მიაძახებს:yells something to someone</code>, and <code>წამოიძახებს:cries out something</code>, which all contain <code>ძახ</code> as their root and contain a vague sense of doing something loudly with your mouth. In my experience, it can be helpful when seeing or hearing words for the first time, to get a sense of the meaning, but more often then not, there are shades of nuance that require explicit learning of the meaning.</p>
<h2 id="pfsf-present-future-stem-formant"><abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> (Present-Future Stem Formant)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> (Present-Future Stem Formant)<br />
Ⓗ: PSF, thematic suffix</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> is a vowel consonant pair that is affixed to the root of the verb in the first screeve (e.g. <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>, etc. – those marked with ① in this document). However, sometimes there is no consonant (<code>ჭრის:cuts</code>) and sometimes there is no <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> at all (<code>წერს:writes</code>). It is not necessary to memorize the below list, but it is helpful to review them to get a feel for what verbs look and sound like in some of the more common tenses.</p>
<ul>
<li>ავ</li>
<li>ამ</li>
<li>ან</li>
<li>ევ</li>
<li>ებ</li>
<li>ემ</li>

<li>ოფ</li>
<li>ი</li>
<li>∅</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="types-of-verbs">Types of Verbs</h1>
<p>There are 5 main types of verbs. Unlike some languages that have clearly defined verb classes, Georgian has vague approximations. The descriptions below should be used as a guide, rather than a strict classification to memorize. As mentioned in the introduction, each teacher, researcher, or reference may have a specific way of refererring to the different types of verbs.</p>
<p>Since this guide mostly follows <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>'s simplified classification, be forwarned that mapping to more formal categorizations may seem a bit clunky. If you have any comments about the classification scheme, please let me know at <code>parry</code>@<code>parryc.com</code>.</p>
<h2 id="-class">ვ-class</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Active, Passive, or Medial voice verbs<br />
Ⓗ: Class 1, 2, or 3<br />
Ⓞ: [<abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>] default classification</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verbs use ვ-class person markers to mark the subject. Most verbs are this type of verb, however, many common verbs (such as <em>to have</em>) are not ვ-class. It is generally safe to assume a new verb is ვ-class and someone will quickly tell you – or look very confused – if you are wrong.</p>
<h3 id="-class-transitive-vs-intransitive">ვ-class: Transitive vs. Intransitive</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Transitive verbs act on an object, intransitive do not<br />
Ⓗ: Class 1 is transitive, class 2 is intransitive<br />
Ⓞ: [<abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>] transitive verbs are unmarked, see below for variations</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the guidance of <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr> (described below), this document does not follow the traditional definition of transitive vs. intransitive, because it is not particularly helpful to the learner. That is, rather than using Ⓚ's description of transitive verbs have an object and intransitive verbs don't, I simply use the designation given in <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because to a learner, knowing which case to use is much more important than formal categorizations. As you will see below, transitive verbs take one set of case markers and intransitive take a different set.</p>
<p>As a quick rule of thumb, intranstive verbs end with <em>-ება</em> in <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr>.<abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> and transitive verbs end with something else (<em>-ებს</em>, <em>-ავს</em> etc.).</p>
<h2 id="-class_1">მ-class</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Passive, Medio-passive<br />
Ⓗ: Class 4<br />
Ⓞ: [<abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>] <em>v inv</em> (inverted verb), indirect verbs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>მ-class verbs use the მ-class markers listed above to mark the subject in all cases. It is important to remember that in <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, the subject, if declinable, will be in <abbr title="Dative">DAT</abbr>. This class is referred to as inverted verbs in <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr> because they invert the more common subject/object markers found with ვ-class verbs.</p>
<h2 id="motion-verbs">Motion Verbs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ⓚ: Motion verbs<br />
Ⓗ: Basic verbs of motion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These verbs are all based on the core sense of "to go". With prefixes, the meaning changes to indicate going in a specific direction. They are all conjugated the same, regardless of prefix.</p>
<h2 id="irregular-verbs">Irregular Verbs</h2>
<p>You won't be able to count them all on your hands (plus one toe) like in Irish, but surprisingly, not all of Georgian verbs are irregular. That said, there are a number of irregularities, especially for common verbs like <code>ამბობს:says</code> and <code>აქვს:has</code>. Some of the more common ones are listed <a href="#common-irregular-verbs">below</a>.</p>
<h1 id="using-the-dictionary-to-look-up-verbs">Using the Dictionary to Look-Up Verbs</h1>
<p>My go-to online dictionary is <a href="translate.ge">translate.ge</a> because it is a more or less quick way of searching the Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary (<abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr>) edited by Donald Rayfied.</p>
<p>There are, however, some caveats:</p>
<ol>
<li>It doesn't support what <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr> has as superscripted ს or ჰ, indicating the, occasionally optional, prefixed <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> person marker. Examples of this are ჰყავს, where ჰ in the print edition is superscripted (<sup>ჰ</sup>ყავს).</li>
<li>Some entries are randomly truncated.</li>
<li>Some entries were poorly entered, and contain Latin text that needs to be "transliterated" (aka, pretend you're typing it on a Georgian keyboard), to see what was intended.</li>
<li>It doesn't contain any of the very important front-matter that the print edition contains.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can't fix 1-3, but I can provide what information from the front-matter I found helpful.</p>
<p>Almost all verbs are listed sepatately in their <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> (unprefixed) form and <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> (prefixed) form. Future tense definitions are written in the future tense in English (e.g. will write). The present tense form can often be found simply by removing the prefix.</p>
<p>Next to a verb entry, in parentheses, the <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> and <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> forms are listed. Irregular forms or other conjugation notes will be listed afterwards, if they exist. For example, in <em>წერს (დაწერა, დაუწერია) writes sth</em>, წერს is <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, დაწერა is <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>, and დაუწერია is <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr>. If an irregular <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr> form is given, <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> follows from that form.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if the definition is for the <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> form, the sense is imperfective. If the definition is for the <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> form, the sense is perfective. In cases where something can be both imperfective or perfective, it is marked with <em>I/O</em> and the English definition indicates the most common usage.</p>
<p>Rayfield writes that "[they] have simplified considerably the classification of Georgian verbs accepted among linguists and used in <a href="http://ena.ge/explanatory-online">KEGL</a>" and I would agree. Since this is the dictionary of choice, it is also the classification that will be used across this site.</p>
<p>The classification is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transitive if 2nd screeve is <abbr title="Subject">SUBJ</abbr>=<abbr title="Ergative">ERG</abbr>, <abbr title="Object">OBJ</abbr>=<abbr title="Nominative">NOM</abbr></li>
<li>Intransitive if 2nd screeve is <abbr title="Subject">SUBJ</abbr>=<abbr title="Nominative">NOM</abbr></li>
<li>Inverse if მ-class</li>
</ul>
<p>What this means, then is that some transitive verbs have no object and some intransitive verbs have an object. This will probably rub some of you the wrong way and that's OK – there are plenty of other resources that dive into the minutae of Georgian verbs. As a learner, however, this type of distinction is invaluable, since there is often no other reliable way to know what case the 2nd screeve is in without asking a Georgian speaker. Where necessary, I have clarified what other resources refer to the verbal classes as, so you can map them to your own learning materials.</p>
<p>This type of classification means that the number of "pieces" for the verb must be indicated too. These are listed below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>vt1</dt>
<dd>transitive verb, just a subject. Ex. <code>ტირის:cries</code>.</dd>
<dt>vt2</dt>
<dd>(default marker), transitive verb, subject and direct object. Only marked if not obvious. Ex. <code>აკეთებს:does something</code>.</dd>
<dt>vt3</dt>
<dd>transitive verb, subject, direct object, and indirect object. Ex. <code>აძლევს:gives something to someone</code>.</dd>
<dt>vt4</dt>
<dd>transitive verb, subject, direct object, indirect object, and the person on whose behalf the action was done. Ex. <code>დაუჭმევს:will let somebody's something be eaten by something</code>. As you can imagine, these types of verbs are rare.</dd>
<dt>vi1</dt>
<dd>intransitive verb, just a subject. Ex. <code>ეცლება:has time</code>.</dd>
<dt>vi2</dt>
<dd>intransitive verb, subject and indirect object. Ex. <code>ელოდება:waits for someone</code>.</dd>
<dt>vi3</dt>
<dd>intransitive verb, subject, direct object, and indirect object. Ex. <code>ეუბნება:says something to someone</code></dd>
<dt>v inv</dt>
<dd>მ-class verbs. Ex. <code>ჰყავს:has a person</code>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Other markers of interest include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>vo</dt>
<dd>transitive verb with objective version (უ-), i.e. for someone else.</dd>
<dt>vs</dt>
<dd>transitive verb with subjective version (ი-), i.e. for oneself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Compare <code>უწერს:(vo) writes something for someone</code>, <code>იწერს:(vs) writes something down for oneself</code>, and <code>წერს:writes something</code>.</p>

<p>A screeve, from the word <em>მწკრივი</em>, meaning "row", is the traditional way of naming a verbal tense for Georgian verbs. This document will use tense, since it is a term a learner is more likely to be familiar with. Of the 11 tenses listed below, there are 3 series, denoted by ①, ②, or ③ before the tense name. Tenses in the same series are often clearly derived from each other (e.g. adding a preverb) and share the same case declensions.</p>
<p>Since as a rule each series' base form cannot be derived by knowing a form in a different series, it is in theory necessary to memorize three different forms when learning a new verb. That is, one form from the 1st series, one from the 2nd series, and one from from the 3rd series. However, the 3rd series, as you will read below, is not very commonly used and no one would fault you for not specifically memorizing a 3rd series form, especially when just starting out. Note that entries from <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr> will list the two additional necessary forms after the <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> and <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> entries (in order, ② <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> and ③ <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr>).</p>
<p>The series and screeves are, as follows. You will see that under ① series are grouped into two large sections. There are sometimes referred to in literature as the present and future subseries, respectively. They are so grouped because they are derived from each other – <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> &gt; <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr> &gt; <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>, <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> &gt; <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr> &gt; <abbr title="Future Subjunctive">FUTSBJV</abbr>. This document will use the same grouping to help make patterns more obvious.</p>

<p>Georgian does not have an infinitive in the sense that many languages have it. That is there is no "to go", but rather the "base" form is often the verbal noun, thus "going". It can therefore be confusing how to structure sentences that would normally use the infintive in other languages.</p>
<p>It is important, but not critical, to learn the verbal noun form when learning a new verb. In some cases, there may not be one, or it may not be common enough for a native speaker to recall it to mind right away. However, one trick that often works is to add <em>-ება</em> to the root of the verb.</p>
<p>For example, <code>აკეთებს:does</code> → <code>კეთ</code> → <code>კეთება:doing</code>. This doesn't always work (ex. <code>ლაპარაკი:talking</code>), but will often work in a pinch if you cannot remember (or never knew) the verbanl noun form.</p>
<p>There are more examples about how and when to use the verbal noun below, in the section <a href="#using-the-verbal-noun">Using the Verbal Noun</a>. In translations of commands (such as on the computer), the verbal noun is often equivalent to English imparatives.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-form-prs">How to Form: <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr></h3>
<p><attn>✎ Base form</attn></p>
<p>The present tense is the most likely form you will encounter when learning a new verb. Depending on the source, you may find that the standard form given differs between which person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) is used.</p>
<p>For example, <abbr title="A Comprehensive Georgian-English Dictionary">CGED</abbr> will give all verbs in <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> (unless <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> is rarely used), whereas Kiziria gives <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr> as the citation form. As a learner, it is imprtant to pick one citation form and stick with it.</p>
<p><strong><em>ვ-class transitive and intransitive</em></strong></p>

<p>As with <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>, the negative imparative (don't!) may be formed with <code>ნუ:don't</code> and the verb in <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>.</p>

<p>The imperfect, as described by Kiziria, is for "actions in the past that occurred frequently, habitually, or for certain periods of time".<cite><a href="#kiziria">Kiziria 142</a></cite> It may also indicate past actions that were interrupted by another action.<cite><a href="#kurtsikidze">Kurtsikidze 129</a></cite> These interrupted actions often take the form of <code>როცა IMPF, AOR</code>, where the IMPF is the tense for the interrupted action and <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> is the tense for the interrupting action.</p>
<p>As this tense does not have a preverb, it has imperfective aspect.</p>

<p><abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr> is used to express wishes, possibilities, or things that could or should be happening, but aren't at the present moment. If there is a chance that it could happen use the <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr> instead, otherwise, keep using <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>. It is found in hypothetical conditions and must be followed by <code>რომ:if</code> or one of <code>უნდა:wants</code>, <code>უნდა:must</code>, <code>იქნებ:perhaps</code>, <code>უნატრის:wishes for something</code>, <code>შეიძლება:it is possible</code> or similar words.</p>

<p>When paired with <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr>, <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr> is often the first clause in the condition, and always marked with <code>რომ:if</code>.

<h3 id="how-to-use-fut">How to Use: <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr></h3>
<p>Similar to other languages, <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> indicates a potential future action. Unlike some languages that have a definite and indefinite future, there is no such distinction in Georgian.</p>
<p><abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> can be used in conditional sentences – if you build it, they will come – but with some nuance.</p>
<p>In most cases, if the conditions are real (or potentially real), then both clauses must be in <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>. One most often uses <code>თუ:if</code> with these types of conditional sentences. When using other common conjunctions, such as <em>რომ</em> and <em>როცა</em>, the conjunctions have a sense of "when" or "after". All three words must come before the verb, however <em>თუ</em> and <em>როცა</em> may also come before the subject, where as <em>რომ</em> may not.</p>
<p>As with <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, the negative imparative (don't!) may be formed with <code>ნუ:don't</code> and the verb in <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>.</p>
<p>A polite suggestion can be formed with <em>ხომ</em> and <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>. For example, <ex><em>ხომ შეჭამ სენდვიჩს?</em> ⧸ will you eat a sandwich?</ex> This is considered more suggestive and less formal than the similar form using <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-cond">How to Use: <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr></h3>
<p>This the "I would do this" tense – hypothetical or desirious scenarios, that are likely or possible to happen, such as describing future scenarios. These types of sentences are often marked with pairs of words such as <code>ალბათ:maybe, perhaps</code>/<code>თუ:if</code> and <code>მაშინ:then</code>. In these types of sentences, the current (<abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>) or future clause (<abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>) would be marked with <code>თუ:if</code> and the <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr> clause preceded by <code>მაშინ:then</code>.</p>
<p><abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr> is also used for frequent actions in the past that are completed. Indeed, due the preverb, this is perfective, and thus refers to whole actions. Compared to <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr>, which is imperfective, and thus refers to actions that do not yet contain their own end. These types of sentences often contain <code>ხოლმე:normally</code> immediately after the verb.</p>
<p>One can also form a polite suggestion, akin to "won't you...?" with <em>ხომ</em> and the negative <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr>. For example, <ex><em>ხომ არ შეჭამდი სენდვიჩს?</em> ⧸ Won't you eat a sandwich?</ex> This is considered more polite than a similar form with <em>ხომ</em> but with <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-futsbjv">How to Use: <abbr title="Future Subjunctive">FUTSBJV</abbr></h3>
<p><abbr title="Future Subjunctive">FUTSBJV</abbr> is very similar to <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>, but as indicated by the existence of the preverb and the word "future", it has a perfective aspect and it cannot be used to refer to actions currently going on, but rather only actions in the future. Compare these two examples<cite><a href="#kurtsikidze">Kurtsikidze, p133</a></cite>:</p>
<p>First, in <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>: <ex><em>ნეტავი ვიოლინოს უკრაფდე</em> ⧸ I wish that you were playing the violin (currently, as I'm speaking)</ex>. Here is where the idea of imperfective aspect comes in: the action, "playing" does not have an explicit start or end, but rather it is that the sense of wishing is for the violin playing to have been occurring.</p>
<p>Compare this with the <abbr title="Future Subjunctive">FUTSBJV</abbr>, which has a perfective aspect (indicated by the preverb და-): <ex><em>ნეტავი ვიოლინოს დაუკრაფდე</em> ⧸ I wish you would play the violin</ex>. Rather than "I wish you were playing", the "would" in the translation clearly indicates that the desire is for the start, middle, and end of violin playing to occur at some future point.</p>
<p>When paired with <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr>, <abbr title="Future Subjunctive">FUTSBJV</abbr> is often the first clause in the condition, and always marked with <code>რომ:if</code>. For example, <ex><em>რომ დახატავდე, მეც დავხატავდი</em> ⧸ If you draw, I will also draw</ex>.<cite><a href="#kurtsidikidze">Kurtsikidze, p133</a></cite></p>

<p><strong><em>ვ-class transitive and intransitive</em></strong></p>
<p>This form should be memorized. In general, though, <em>-ებ</em> will be removed if it exists and the ending vowels will follow one of the following patterns (non-<abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> – <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr>):</p>
<ol>
<li>ე-ა</li>
<li>ი-ო</li>
<li>ი-ა</li>
<li>იე-ია</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr>, <abbr title="1st Person Plural">1PL</abbr>, <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr>, <abbr title="2nd Person Plural">2PL</abbr>, <abbr title="3rd Person Plural">3PL</abbr> will have the same vowel (such as <em>ე</em>) and <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> will have a different one (<em>ა</em>). <em>ე-ა</em> is more common with transitive verbs and <em>ი-ო</em> is more common with instransitive verbs. <em>ი-ა</em> is most likely with verbs ending in <em>-ავ</em> or <em>-ამ</em>.<cite><a href="#kurtsikidze">Kurtsikidze, p137</a></cite> Verbs ending in <em>-ევ</em> will take the 4th pattern, <em>იე-ია</em>.</p>
<p>Some verbs may change roots in <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> (and thus in <abbr title="Optative">OPT</abbr>, as well). A common change is the addition of an <em>ა</em> before letters such as <em>ლ</em> or <em>რ</em>. When this occurs, it almost always only impacts the 1st and 2nd person forms. For example, with the verb <code>ასწრებს:has time to do something</code>, we have in <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> <em>მოასწრო</em>, but in <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> <em>მოვასწარი</em> with an <code>-ა-</code> before <em>რ</em>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-aor">How to Use: <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr></h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> is very similar to what is called the past tense in English. Generally speaking, as it has a preverb, it will indicate a past completed action. Depending on context, it may function similarly to the English past perfect (e.g. "I had done" versus "I did"), often with <code>უკვე:already</code>. When expressing a negative past action (e.g. "I didn't see her"), often <a href="#how-to-use-evd"><abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr></a> is used instead.</p>
<p>There is an uncommon form without the preverb that indicates the action took place in the past and was incomplete, similar to "had been doing" in English. It occurs often in the form of "{<abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> without prefix}, {<abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> without prefix}, და {<abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> with prefix}" to mean that someone or something "did and did and (finally) completed it". This is illustrated in the saying <ex><em>თაგვმა თხარა, თხარაო, კატა გამოთახრაო</em> ⧸ (They say) the mouse dug and dug, and dug up a cat</ex>. <code>თხარა:dug</code> is unprefixed and implies that the action of digging was not completed. <code>გადათხარა:dug (up)</code>, with the prefix, indicates the action of digging was done and compeleted – in this case because the mouse dug up a cat. The saying is used to warn someone they might get in trouble if they keep doing what they're doing.</p>
<p><abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> also functions as the imperative when in <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr>. Thus, <em>გააკეთე</em> can be either "you did it" or "do it!". The imperative is negated with <em>ნუ</em>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>იყო:was</code> may be affixed to past participles, eliding the last <em>-ი</em> of the past participle, as in <code>გაყინულიყო:it was frozen</code> versus <code>გაყინული იყო</code>.</p>

<p>Regarding the two <abbr title="3rd Person Plural">3PL</abbr> forms, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1">Wiktionary</a>, as well as Ⓗ, list <em>იყონ</em>, though Ⓚ does not. Brosset 1837, p73 lists <em>იყვნენ</em> as the colloquial register and <em>იყონ</em> as the literary register. <a href="https://tbiliselebi.ge/ka/news/vilaparakot-qartulad/vilaparakot-kartulad-1621">ვლაპარკობთ ქართულად</a> explicitly lists <em>იყვნენ</em> as the preferred term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>იყვნენ და არა იყონ. ([Say] იყვნენ and not იყონ)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, as a reverse of <em>Brosset</em> some two hundred odd years later, for some speakers, it appears that <em>იყონ</em> is now the more common spoken form, as opposed to <em>იყვნენ</em>. This may be a regional preference and appears that western dialects prefer <em>იყონ</em>. If you know more, please let me know.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-use-opt">How to Use: <abbr title="Optative">OPT</abbr></h3>
<p>The optative is a very common (and thus, important!) tense as it follows many common verbs: <code>უნდა:wants/should</code>, <code>შეუძლია:is able</code>, <code>მოდი:let's</code>, <code>საჭიროა:it is necessary</code>. It is broadly used to describe action that is done with intention, necessity, possibility, desirability, etc.<cite><a href="#kiziria">Kiziria, p180</a></cite></p>
<p>When used independently in questions, it gives the sense of "should/shall ... ?".</p>
<p>The optative plural is also used in recipes, for example <ex><em>მოვხარშოთ ცოტა ბრინჯი</em> ⧸ Cook a small amount of rice.</ex><cite><a href="#kurtsikidze">Kurtsikidze, p147</a></cite></p>
<p>When expressing past desires, rather than current desires, please <a href="#having-wanted-to-do-something-verb">see below</a> for more information. <abbr title="Optative">OPT</abbr> is only used after non-past verbs.<cite><a href="#aronson">Aronson, p285</a></cite></p>

<h3 id="how-to-form-evd">How to Form: <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr></h3>
<p><attn>✎ Derived from <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>, has preverb</attn></p>
<p><strong><em>ვ-class transitive and intransitive</em></strong></p>
<p>The key thing to know with <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> is that even ვ-class verbs will use მ-class subject markers. Thus, from <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>, change the subject markers to be the same as მ-class, though with the addition of <em>ი</em> after the marker and <em>უ</em> for <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> and <abbr title="3rd Person Plural">3PL</abbr>. For example, შე<strong>მი</strong>ჭამია for <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> and შე<strong>უ</strong>ჭამია for <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr>.</p>
<p>The vowel of the endings will be <em>ია</em> in all cases, except for when the verb ends in <em>ავ</em> or <em>ამ</em>, in which case there are no vowel endings and instead the endings are <em>-ს</em> (and <em>-თ</em> for plural).</p>
<p>Since the object markers have switched, this begs the question, how does one mark the object on the verb? In almost all cases, the object will not be marked on the verb, but rather the standalone pronoun will be used. If the object is an indirect object, then it will have <em>-თვის</em> suffixed.</p>
<p>However, in some cases, where the direct object can be a person, the <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> form of <em>to be</em> is suffixed to the verb (dropping the final <em>-ა</em>). Thus, <ex><em>გამიგზავნიხარ</em> ⧸ I had sent you (to the store, etc.)</ex>, where <code>-მი-:1SG.SUBJ</code> and <code>-ხარ:2SG.DO</code>. As well as, <ex><em>მინახავხარ</em> ⧸ I have seen you</ex>. Compare the first example with <ex><em>გამიგზავნია შენთვის</em> ⧸ I sent to you (a letter)</ex>, where <em>შენ</em> is standalone, since it is not the direct object of the verb.</p>
<p>Note that Aronson specifies that this occurs with verbs that have a <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> of <em>ავ</em> or <em>ამ</em>.<cite><a href="#aronson">Aronson, p391</a></cite> However, Bolkvadze &amp; Kiziria do not make such a distinction, specifying that this occurs with any "bipersonal" verbs.<cite><a href="#comprehensive">Bolkvadze &amp; Kiziria, p274</a></cite> This is most obvious in <em>დამიპატიჟებიხარ</em>, which does not have an <em>ავ</em> or <em>ამ</em> <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr>, but clearly has <em>-ხარ</em> suffixed. This form is also referenced on <a href="https://tbiliselebi.ge/ka/news/vilaparakot-qartulad/vilaparakot-kartulad-7590">tbiliselebi.ge</a>, further lending credence to it being a valid and expected form.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-evd">How to Use: <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common use of <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> for a beginner, especially in common speech, is expressing a "neutral" negative past action. See the 2nd paragraph for more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ⓗ calls this the Perfect form. Perfect here, contrasted with Perfective, means that the action took place in the past, before the present action which is occurring. This is true, but more importantly, there is a sense that the speaker did not experience the past event first hand. It is akin to English expressions such as "apparently", "evidently", or "it seems s/he has", but without the sense of doubt that is often conveyed in such English suggestions. As such, one often finds this tense paired with <code>თურმე:apparently</code>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> in the negative is contrasted in everyday speech with <a href="#how-to-use-aor"><abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr></a> in the negative. <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> with the negative would indicate a past action that didn't happen, with a neutral reason. <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> in the negative, however, would imply that the action intentionally did not happen. Compare <ex><em>ის პერანგი არ მიყიდია</em> ⧸ I didn't buy the shirt (<abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr>)</ex> and <ex><em>ის პერანგი არ ვიყიდე</em> ⧸ I didn't buy the shirt (<abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>) [because I didn't feel like it]</ex>.<cite><a href="#aronson">Aronson, p276</a></cite> Thus, when answering questions about the past, one is more likely to hear <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> as a negative answer to a question and <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> as the positive answer, because in these cases, each has a neutral sense. Some speakers may not make the distinction between <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr> and <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> and will default to <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> negative past events. This lack of distinction may be perceived as "uneducated".</p>
<p>It may also be used to express surprise, mirroring loosely the English expression "what a xyz".<cite><a href="#aronsonkiziria">Aronson and Kiziria, p392</a></cite> In <ex><em>ფერად შვინდი ბაგე გქონია</em> ⧸ You had lips the color cherries</ex>, it's not a neutral statement of fact, but an expression of surprise/admiration/unexpectedness of the fact.</p>
<p>When used with "to be", it is equivalent to "has been" in English. For example, <ex><em>საქართველოში არ ვყოფილვარ</em> ⧸ I have not been to Georgia</ex>.</p>
<p>One may also hear the perfect aspect be expressed with a <a href="https://leflan.eu/r/learns/georgian#past-passive-participles">past passive participle</a> and <code>აქვს:has</code>. That is, <em>წაგიკითხავს?</em> and <em>წაკითხული გაქვს?</em> both mean "have you read it?"</p>

<p><attn>✎ Derived from <abbr title="Evidential">EVD</abbr>, has preverb</attn></p>
<p>There is a lot of variation in how this class is formed. Don't worry, you'll probably be close enough for the listener to understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>ვ-class transitive and intransitive</em></strong></p>
<p>The most general way is to change both the person marker and the ending. The person markers change to be the მ-class markers, but with <em>ე-</em> as the version. Thus, <em>მე-</em>, <em>გე-</em> etc. This means that any existing version markers (or generally speaking, initial vowels) will be dropped in favor of <em>ე</em>. The ending vowel is then changed to -ა.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of variations that can occur:</p>
<ul>
<li>in some verbs ending with <em>ებ</em> or <em>ევ</em> (most often 3-syllable or more), the suffix is retained and the ending is <em>-ია</em>.</li>
<li>
<p>for verbs that would end with <em>-ო</em> in <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>, they will end with <em>-ო</em> instead of <em>-ა</em>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-pstsbjv">How to Use: <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr></h3>
<p>The <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr> has two main functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describing an action that occurs in the past, but prior to a past timeframe already established</li>
<li>Expressing wishes of a hypothetical past that cannot be achieved (e.g. I was supposed to do it)</li>
</ol>
<p>As you may guess from the 1st function and Ⓗ's naming, this could tense could also be called the pluperfect. However, since hypothetical past conditionals is the main place this is used, for the purpose of this document, <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr> will take precedence in naming. Plus, it has nice parallelism with the other subjunctive tenses.</p>
<p>These hypothetical conditionals are often formed with the first clause in <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr> (hypothetical past result) and the second clause (hypothetical past action) in <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr>. This type of conditional sentence is always marked with <em>რომ</em> in the second clause. More information on expressing past desires can be found <a href="#having-wanted-to-do-something-verb">below</a>.</p>
<p>If the sentence describes an action that occurred in the past, but prior to some established time frame (function 1 above), it can appear standalone as the only verb in the sentence. You can think of the sentence as the answer to the question <em>რა მექნა?</em>, which can be thought of as "What had you done (before then)?" or "What did you do (before then)?" In general, though, this requires some context and as such, sentences with single clause and a bare verb in <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr> are uncommon.</p>
<p>Most sentences that would be expressed in the pluperfect in English ("had done") would be expressed with <code>უკვე</code> + <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>. For example, from Aronson (p278), <ex><em>თქვენ უკვე გნზხეთ, როცა ადვოკატი მოვიდა</em> ⧸ I had already seen you all when the lawyer came</ex>.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-du">How to Use: <abbr title="Drunk Uncle">DU</abbr></h3>
<p>An uncommonly used tense, restricted mostly to things a drunk uncle would do: talking about past actions the speaker has no memory of doing and giving toasts.</p>
<p><abbr title="Drunk Uncle">DU</abbr> is also contrasted with <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr> when talking about <a href="#having-wanted-to-do-something-verb">past desired actions</a>.</p>

<h1 id="common-sentence-patterns">Common Sentence Patterns</h1>
<p>Without an infinitive form like in many other languages, mapping sentence structures from your native language to Georgian can be difficult. To help mitigate that, this section is designed to help identify some common sentence patterns and how they are constructed in Georgian. Any comments, questions, or additions are warmly welcomed at <code>parry (ათ) parryc.com</code></p>
<h2 id="negation">Negation</h2>
<p>Verbs can be negated in Georgian in two ways, with <code>არ</code> and <code>ვერ</code>. <code>ვერ</code> implies an inability to complete the action, whereas <code>არ</code> is simply that the action didn't occur. Compare below:</p>
<ul>
<li>ვერ მოვდივარ:I'm not able to come</li>
<li>არ მოვდივარ:I'm not coming</li>
</ul>
<p>Note also that involuntary/unconscious actions must be negated with <em>ვერ</em>. Thus, <ex><em>ვერ შევამჩნიე</em> ⧸ I didn't notice it</ex>, as "to notice something" is an unconscious action (you cannot deliberately not notice something).</p>
<p>There are two modified versions of <em>არ</em> and <em>ვერ</em>, <em>აღარ</em> and <em>ვეღარ</em> respectively, which add the meaning of "any longer" to the negative. For example, <ex><em>მე აღარ ვტირი</em> ⧸ I no longer cry</ex>.</p>
<p>Imparatives are negated with <code>ნუ:don't</code>.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-verbal-noun">Using the Verbal Noun</h2>
<p>To help ease the transition to this infinitiveless world, below are some common structures that English speakers would expect to use the infinitive, but instead should use the verbal noun.</p>
<p><strong>It is X to Y</strong></p>
<p>The "It is X" clause is marked with <code>-ა:is</code> and the "to Y" clause is a verbal noun. For example, <ex><em>ზამთარში ძნელია საწოლიდან ადგომა</em> ⧸ It is difficult to get up from the bed in winter</ex>. Or, more literally, "Getting up from bed in the winter is difficult".</p>
<p><strong>It is X as it is Y</strong></p>
<p>The first clause is often in the present tense and the second clause is often a vebal noun. For example, <ex><em>კითხულობთ როგორც იწერება</em> ⧸<br />
It is read as it is written</ex>. Note that the first clause "it is read" is actually in <abbr title="2nd Person Plural">2PL</abbr>.<abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>.</p>
<p><strong>I like to X</strong></p>
<p>As with above, X will be a verbal noun. This means that the English equivalent can be rephrased to use a verbal noun as well. For example, rather than "I like to dance", "I like dancing" would work. Thus, you have <ex><em>ცეკვა მომწონს</em> ⧸ I like to dance</ex>.</p>
<p><strong><em>A more complicated example</em></strong></p>
<p>Here is an example worked in more detail.</p>
<dl>
<dt>შემდებ, ვაპირებ გამოცდების ჩაბარებას მაგისტრატურისთვის.</dt>
<dd>Next, I plan to pass the exam for the Master's degree.</dd>
</dl>
<p><code>აპირებს:plans to</code> takes the standard 2 arguments of subject and object. The subject, we can see is <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr>, from <em>ვ-</em> in <code>ვაპირებ:I plan to</code>. That means there are three other words that can be the object – only one of them, <code>ჩაბარებას:passing of the exam.VN.DAT</code> is in the <abbr title="Dative">DAT</abbr>. This is a verbal noun form, thus "passing of (an exam)". That means that <code>გამოცდების:exam.GEN</code> modifies the VN, leaving <code>მაგისტრატურისთვის:master's degree=for</code> as the indirect object of <code>ჩაბარებას</code>.</p>
<p>This is a good example of how to take a common verb form and make a verbal phrase with the object:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decline the verbal noun in the correct object tense (here, <abbr title="Dative">DAT</abbr>).</li>
<li>Decline what would be the direct object of the verbal noun in <abbr title="Genitive">GEN</abbr> – e.g. "the exam's passing".</li>
<li>Suffix any indirect objects with <code>-თვის:for</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you may also hear the form <em>რომ {declined verb}</em>, that is, a sentence like <ex><em>მომწონს, სათამაშობს რომ ვაკეთებ</em> ⧸ I like to make toys</ex>, rather than <em>მომწონს, სათამაშობის კეთება</em>.<cite><a href="#kurtsikidze">Kurtsikidze, p193</a></p>
<h2 id="on-the-verge-of-doing-something-">On the verge of doing something (ე- -ებოდეს)</h2>
<p>An alternative form of the <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr> which indicates that the subject is on the verge of doing something, it is formed by wrapping the root in <em>ე- -ებოდეს</em>. It can also be though of as "about to" or "going to", i.e. "about to cry". It is only used with emotions or feelings.</p>
<p>For example, from <em>ვანო და ნიკო</em>:</p>
<p>როცა ეტირებოდეს — ტიროდეს, ეცინებოდეს — და იცინოდეს...</p>
<p>When he was about to cry, he would cry, when he was about to laugh, he would laugh...</p>
<p>Thus, <code>ტირის:cries</code> → <code>ეტირებოდეს:about to cry</code>.</p>
<h2 id="causative-verbs-to-makelet-someone-do-something-">Causative verbs / to make/let someone do something (-ებ/ინებ/ევ)</h2>
<p><attn>As with most things with Georgian verbs, the suffix used varies, but <em>-ინებ</em> is a safe choice.</attn></p>
<p>This suffix is placed after the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> (e.g. after <em>-ავ</em>, <em>-ებ</em>, etc.). It adds the sense of "making/letting the object do the action". For example, <code>ვაკეთებ:I'm doing</code> becomes <ex><em>ვაკეთებინებ</em> ⧸ I'm making/letting her/him do it</ex>. Colloquial Georgian may drop the first <em>-ებ</em>, yielding <em>ვაკეთინებ</em></p>
<p>If the <abbr title="Present Future Stem Format">PFSF</abbr> begins with a vowel other than <em>ე</em> or <em>ო</em>, the vowel is dropped. For example, the <em>ა</em> in <em>-ავ</em> is dropped in <ex>ვხატვინებ ⧸ I'm making/letting her/him draw</ex>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all verbs will have an <em>ა-</em> version marker. For example, <code>ვაჭმევინებ:I made him eat</code>, <code>ვაკითხუბინებ:I made him read</code>, <code>ვაწერინებ:I made her write</code>. This most often manifests with verbs that would not normally have one, such as <code>წერს:s/he writes</code>.</p>
<p>Since it is just the suffix of the verb changing, object markers are the same as with other non-causative forms. Here are the forms in <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, subject on the left, object along the top.</p>

<p>Note that some verbs cannot be made causitive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verbs of motion</li>
<li>მ-class verbs</li>

<li>Verbs in which the object is implied</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="have-done-past-participle-to-have">Have done (Past Participle + to have)</h2>
<p>Depending on the tense of <code>აქვს:to have</code>, there are various equivalent meanings in English. Examples below from Ⓚ.</p>
<dl>
<dt><abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> = I have done:</dt>
<dd><ex><em>ეს წიგნი წაკითხული მაქვს</em> ⧸ I have read this book</ex>.</dd>
<dt><abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> = I will have done:</dt>
<dd><ex><em>ხვალისათვის ეს წიგნი წაკითხული მექნება</em> ⧸ I will have read this book by tomorrow</ex>.</dd>
<dt><abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> = I had done:</dt>
<dd><ex><em>საქართველოში რომ ჩავედი, ეს ლექსები უკვე წავითხული მქონდა</em> ⧸ When I arrived in Georgia, I had already read these poems</ex>.</dd>
</dl>
<p>An exception to this is "had been doing", which corresponds to <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr> or <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> (without a preverb).</p>
<h2 id="keep-doing-imp-vn">Keep doing (მიდი + IMP/გააგრძელებს + VN)</h2>
<p>There are two ways of saying "to keep doing something", depending on the meaning. If it is for encouragement, such as "keep going!", it is <code>მიდი:go</code> plus the imperative form of the action (same as <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>). For the other meaning of "to continue doing something", then it is the verb <code>გააგრძელებს:will continue</code> (<abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> form) with the verbal noun of the action.</p>
<h2 id="redoing-something-verb">Redoing something (თავიდან + verb)</h2>
<p>As you might have noticed, Georgian does not have prefixes that correspond to many of the verbal prefixes in English. One common one is doing an action again. This is indicated with the word <code>თავიდან:from the beginning</code>, such as in <ex><em>თავიდან დაწერა</em> ⧸ S/he rewrote it</ex>.</p>
<h2 id="having-wanted-to-do-something-verb">Having wanted to do something (უნდოდა/ნეტავ + verb)</h2>
<p>When expressing wanting to have done something in the past there are three situations, depending on the nuance you wish to express.</p>
<ol>
<li>should have: უნდა + <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr></li>
<li>wanted to: უნდოდა + <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr> or masdar</li>
<li>if only I had: ნეტავ + <abbr title="Drunk Uncle">DU</abbr></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>should have</strong></p>
<p>When expressing if something should have happened (but didn't), use the bare, undeclined <em>უნდა</em>, paired with <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr>. That is, <ex><em>მე უნდა წავსულიყავი.</em> ⧸ I should have left.</ex></p>
<p><strong>wanted to</strong></p>
<p>First, decline <em>უნდა</em> in <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>. Whether or not you use the masdar of the verb or <abbr title="Past Subjunctive">PSTSBJV</abbr> appears to be a matter of either dialect or personal preference. I have been told that the masdar form may be considered "colloquial" (or perhaps even grammatically incorrect), whereas others have have insisted the declined form is incorrect.</p>
<p>This form implies that the past action was desired in the past, but did not occur. There is less of an implication that the action was compelled by some external force (e.g. obligation, necessity, etc.) than as implied with <em>უნდა</em> above.</p>
<p><strong>if only I had</strong></p>
<p>The form using <abbr title="Drunk Uncle">DU</abbr> and <code>ნეტავ:if only</code> implies a certain level of regret or wistfulness that is not implied with either of the two above forms. Thus, <em>ნეტავ მე წავსულიყო</em> would be "If only I had left (sooner, later, on Monday, etc.)". As one might expect, this form is often seen in poetry.</p>

<p>For <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr>, you may also (rarely?) see/hear a version where the <em>-ო-</em> is dropped, thus, <em>ვეუბნებდი</em>. I have not seen this alteration attested for <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>.</p>
<p>Note that one may encounter a form <em>იამბობს</em>, such as in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A828Q0wLeD8"><em>მოდი გიამბობ</em></a> by Hamlet Gonashvili or in <a href="http://www.nplg.gov.ge/saskolo/index.php?a=term&amp;d=18&amp;t=8780">The Knight in the Panther's Skin</a> that also means "I tell you", but it has a more specific sense of telling a story (or similar). You can see this contrasted in the first two lines of the above linked song — the second line does not use the <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> of <em>ამბობს</em>, rather the <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> of <em>ეუბნება</em>: გიამბობ... ამბავს (I am telling you... a story) vs. გეტყვი... განათებას (I will tell you... at dawn).</p>

<p>მოაქვს and მიაქვს differ in where the "something" is being brought. To help present the differences, assume there are two speakers. With <em>მო-</em>, the object is being brought to the location of the 1st speaker and with <em>მი-</em> the object is being brought to a location different from where either of the speakers are. In the case where the object is being brought is to where the 2nd speaker is, either prefixed form works. If the object is a person or a car, then <em>მოჰყავს</em> and <em>მიჰყავს</em> is used.</p>

<h2 id="to-be-able-can-manages">To be able, can, manages – შეუძლია</h2>
<p>In the table below, there are two forms given for <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> and <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>. In these cases, the meaning changes slightly when using the ვ-forms. The standard მ-forms focuse on the opportunity to be able to do/manage something, but does not imply that the action was actually done. The ვ-forms focus on the results and thus implies that the action was done.</p>
<p>Compare:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>შევძელი საქართველოში წასვლა</em>: I managed to go to Georgia (e.g. I was able and also did so).</li>
<li><em>შემეძლო საქართველოში წასვლა</em>: I could have gone to Georgia (e.g. I had the opportunity to, but did not do so).</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, since there is no მ-form for <abbr title="Optative">OPT</abbr>, there is a focus on completing the task at hand, rather than on acquiring an opportunity. Thus, <ex><em>მე უნდა შევძლო</em> ⧸ I must manage to do (and complete) it</ex>, whereas an English translation of "I must be able to do it", may imply that one must have the permission/opportunity to do it.</p>

<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2 id="what-about-voice">What about voice?</h2>
<p>Ⓚ discusses in some depth (see pgs 118 and 119) and, indeed, derives much of her classification off of the voice of the verb. Although I did not find it helpful when trying to speak (since it does not tell you how to decline the associated nouns), it is useful to summarize it as it is a formal structure that is discussed elswhere.</p>
<p>There are 3 common voices described:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Active</dt>
<dd>A 2-person or 3-person verb where the subject acts upon an object.</dd>
<dt>Passive</dt>
<dd>A 1-person or 2-person verb, where something acts upon the subject. These are futher subdivided into two types: dynamic, describing the process of an action; and static, describing the result of a completed action.</dd>
<dt>Medial</dt>
<dd>A 1-person or 2-person verb, where no action is performed on the subject or on an object. Examples include "going" and "sitting".</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some verbs do not belong to a voice, such as <code>იცის:s/he knows</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-all-the-examples-in-3sg">Why are all the examples in <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr>?</h2>
<p>I don't recall where this form was used as the reference form (though I think it may have been Kurtsikidze?), but I continued to use it because I think it more clearly illustrates that it is a verb as compared to using <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr> as the reference form (as in Kirizia). This is because, to me, at least, <em>(s/he) eats</em> is more clearly the <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> rather than <em>(you) eat</em>. Without the English <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> marker, some examples may be more easily confused with nouns.</p>
<p>If you are learning Georgian via a language other than English, you may find that learning a form other than <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr> is useful. Indeed, I also try memorizing the <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr> form as well, since it it may illustrate root changes not seen in <abbr title="3rd Person Singular">3SG</abbr>.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-some-resources-say-a-form-doesnt-exist-but-one-is-provided-anyways">Why do some resources say a form doesn't exist, but one is provided anyways?</h2>
<p>Usually when a resource says a form doesn't exist, it means that it doesn't have a unique form. It is almost invariably that <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr> and <abbr title="Optative">OPT</abbr> don't exist, which are then often the same as the <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr> and <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr> respectively. I include them since for a learner, it is not useful to know that formally there is no unique form. Rather, it is more important to know "when I mentally think 'use <abbr title="Optative">OPT</abbr>', that I should use the form listed here".</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-imperative">What about the imperative?</h2>
<p>The imperative is the same form as <a href="#2-aorist-aor"><abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr></a>. Check there for more information.</p>
<h2 id="which-motion-verb-should-be-used-for-to-go">Which motion verb should be used for "to go"?</h2>
<p>There are two ways to translate the generic act of "going" into Georgian using the <em>წა-</em> form and the <em>მი-</em> form of motion verbs. Here are the two forms, in <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>, and <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>, for <abbr title="1st Person Singular">1SG</abbr>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th><em>წა-</em> form</th>
<th><em>მი- form</em></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr></td>
<td>∅</td>
<td>მივდივარ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr></td>
<td>წავალ</td>
<td>მივალ</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr></td>
<td>წავედი</td>
<td>მივედი</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Generally speaking, the <em>წა-</em> form is more common and should be the default, especially for the <abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr> screeve forms (<abbr title="Future">FUT</abbr>, <abbr title="Conditional">COND</abbr>, <abbr title="Future Subjunctive">FUTSBJV</abbr>) and <abbr title="Aorist">AOR</abbr>. It <strong>cannot</strong> be used in the <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> or related screeves, as the form simply does not exist.</p>
<p>The <em>მი-</em> form should be used when emphasizing the destination (<ex><em>მივიდა სკოლაში</em> ⧸ He went to the store</ex>), in the <abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr> screeve (<abbr title="Present">PRS</abbr>, <abbr title="Imperfect">IMPERF</abbr>, <abbr title="Present Subjunctive">PRSSBJV</abbr>), or IMP (<ex><em>მიდი მიდი მიდი!</em> ⧸ go, go, go!</ex>).</p>
<h2 id="which-motion-verb-should-be-use-for-to-arrive-or-to-come">Which motion verb should be use for "to arrive" or "to come"?</h2>
<p>Like expressing "to go", above, "to arrive"/"to come"/"to get somewhere" also has two different verb forms: <em>მო-</em> and <em>ჩა-</em>. However, rather than differing based on tense, they differ based on where the arrival occurred, relative to the speaker. When the place arrived at is "here", use <em>მო-</em> and when the place arrived at is "there", use <em>ჩა-</em>.</p>
<h2 id="im-seeing-some-strange-forms-of-to-be-what-are-they">I'm seeing some strange forms of "to be", what are they?</h2>
<p>Georgian has two honorific/polite verb forms for "to be". While they are normally used between strangers or colleagues in formal settings (such as a shopkeeper and a customer, or at a conference), they can also be used ironically between friends. Those with the <em>-ხლ-</em> root have a noticable 2nd person object marker (<em>გ-</em>) and as such, don't have a 2nd person form. These ones could more closely be translated as "to you I am/she is" etc. Similarly, while a <abbr title="2nd Person Singular">2SG</abbr> form exists, it is more often to hear someone use <abbr title="2nd Person Plural">2PL</abbr>, as it has a stronger politeness connotation.</p>
<p>To help illustrate, in the table below the neutral form (as listed in the above sections) is also included.</p>
